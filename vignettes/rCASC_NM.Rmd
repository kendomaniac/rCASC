## Abstract
Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as essential tool to investigate cellular heterogeneity. Nowadays, user-friendly workflows are required to exploit the deconvolution of single-cells transcriptome and these workflows should guarantee the reproducibility of the data analysis. To deal with these aspects, rCASC was developed. rCASC is a modular workflow providing data analysis tools from counts generation to cell sub-population signatures identification, exploiting docker containerization to achieve computational reproducibility in data analysis.

## 1 Introduction 
Single cell analysis is instrumental to understand the functional differences existing among cells within a tissue. Individual cells of the same phenotype are commonly viewed as identical functional units of a tissue or organ. However, single cells sequencing results (Buettner, et al., 2015) suggest the presence of a complex organization of heterogeneous cell states producing together system-level functionalities. 
A mandatory element of single cell RNAseq is the availability of dedicated bioinformatics workflows. rCASC provides such a workflow addressing the problem of functional and computational reproducibility, which is becoming a very important topic, because of the “Data Reproducibility Crisis” (Allison, et al., 2018).

## 2 Methods
rCASC is developed within the umbrella of the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project [(*www.reproducible-bioinformatics.org*, Kulkarni et al., 2018)](www.reproducible-bioinformatics.org), which is an open-source community aiming to develop reproducible bioinformatics workflows. Each module of rCASC is implemented in a docker container, and it is compliant with the rules proposed by Sandve (Sandve, et al., 2013) to guarantee both computational and functional reproducibility. The key elements of rCASC workflow are shown in Fig. 1A, and the main functionalities are summarized below. 

**Data preprocessing**: rCASC provides processing of fastq, derived by 10XGenomics and inDrop platforms, to generate a cell count matrix annotated using ENSEMBL gene model (Supplementary Section 2). Furthermore, any counts matrix can be also processed within rCASC. The most relevant preprocessing modules of rCASC (Supplementary Section 3) allow visualization of the numbers of genes detected in each cell with respect to the cells total reads, removal of low quality cells using Lorenz statistic (Diaz, et al., 2016), removal of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, data normalization (Bacher, et al., 2017), detection of possible cell cycle bias (Liu, et al., 2017) and removal of such effects from the data (Barron and Li, 2016). 

**Cell heterogeneity analysis**: The optimal number of cells partitions is detected inducing perturbations in the structure of the cell data set, i.e. removing a random subset of cells and repeating the clustering. The rational of this approach is that a robust cluster of cells should contain the same set of cells independently by the perturbation of the overall dataset. The bootstrapped dataset is analyzed with a graph-based community detection method (https://github.com/ppapasaikas/griph), allowing the identification of the range of number of clusters observable perturbing the cells dataset structure (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Section 4). Then, the range of number of clusters is probed using SIMLR (Wang, et al., 2017), a clustering framework learning a sample-to-sample similarity measure from expression data. A cell stability score (Supplementary Section 5), indicating the fraction of bootstraps in which a cell is allocated in a specific cluster, is used to identify the optimal number of clusters for the cell sub-populations representation (Fig. 1C). Cells are then plotted in each cluster with a specific symbol indicating its stability (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the shuffling of unstable cells between nearby clusters can be visualized in a video in which each bootstrap is a frame of a video. As alternative options to SIMLR we have also implemented tSne and the hierarchical clustering approach which is part of Seurat R tool kit (Butler et al., 2018, Supplementary Section 6).

**Clusters specific feature selection**: The identification of clusters specific signatures is addressed with three different methods (Supplementary Section 7).  The ANOVA-like method from edgeR (Robinson, et al., 2010) is used in case of the presence a reference cluster, e.g. it could be the cluster of resting cells undergoing to activation/differentiation by an external stimulus. In case a reference cluster is not available SIMLR (Wang, et al., 2017) and Seurat (Butler et al., 2018) provide specific gene prioritization approaches. This information combined with dataset bootstraps allows the identification of genes which are the main players in clusters organization. The genes selected with the above-mentioned approaches can be then visualized with a supervised heatmap ordering cells according to the belonging cluster (Fig. 1E).The cell stability in each cluster is also provided (Fig. 1F). 

**GUI**: Implementation of rCASC functions within [*4SeqGUI*](https://github.com/mbeccuti/4SeqGUI) framework is in progress, to make the analysis workflow suitable for users lacking of scripting knowledge. 


##	Results
The main objective of rCASC is the identification of the most robust partitioning of cell sub-populations within a reproducible framework. The comparison of rCASC with four single-cell analysis workflows (Supplementary Section 9) indicate that rCASC provides unique features, e.g. jackknife resampling for cluster robustness evaluation. The cluster’s robustness, evaluated measuring the persistence of cells in a cluster, as consequence of jackknife resampling, provides a better estimation of clusters stability with respect to other measurements as the silhouette plot (Supplementary Section 5, Fig. 23 A,B). With respect to other workflows, rCASC uses as clustering tool SIMLR or Seurat clustering, which were shown to outer-perform other methods (Wang et al. 2018; Freytag et al. 2018; Duò et al. 2018).
rCASC modularity structure easily allows the implementation of other pre/post processing methods and supports the implementation of other clustering methods within the resampling framework. Furthermore, rCASC is the only workflow granting functional and computational reproducibility. 


## Conclusion
In conclusion, rCASC is a workflow with valuable new features that could help researchers in defining cells sub-populations and detecting sub-population specific markers, under the umbrella of data reproducibility.
